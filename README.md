# Swarm Intelligence-Based method for Multi-Objective Vehicle Routing and Packing (SIB-MOVRP)

This repository contains supplements for the SIB-MOVRP poster:
- Decoding_scenarios.pdf: eight scenarios for packing a package into a space.
- Decoding.gif: Video illustration of the decoding function
- Experiment_Results.md: Package dimensions setting of three logistical configurations and corresponding optimized results given by the baseline method (_Distance-First_) and the proposed SIB-MOVRP algorithm.
